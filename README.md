# 🧠 IntelliVault – Personal Knowledge Vault using RAG

## 📌 Project Overview

IntelliVault is a **Personal Knowledge Vault** that enables users to store their own documents and retrieve information from them using **semantic search and intelligent recall**.
Instead of relying on keyword-based search, the system allows users to ask **natural language questions** and receive **context-aware answers grounded strictly in their uploaded documents**.

The project is built using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach, where relevant document content is retrieved first and then passed to a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students and professionals store large amounts of information in digital documents such as PDFs and notes. Over time, recalling specific information becomes difficult due to poor keyword-based search and lack of context.
This project aims to solve this problem by enabling **semantic recall from personal documents**, allowing users to query their own knowledge base intelligently.

## 💡 Solution Approach

The system follows a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture:

1. User documents are uploaded and processed.
2. Documents are split into smaller chunks.
3. Each chunk is converted into vector embeddings.
4. Embeddings are stored in a vector database.
5. When a user asks a question:

   * Relevant chunks are retrieved using semantic similarity.
   * An LLM generates an answer **only using the retrieved content**.

This ensures **accurate, explainable, and non-hallucinated responses**.

## 🧩 Key Features (MVP Scope)

* Upload PDF or text documents
* Chunk and embed documents
* Store embeddings in a vector database
* Semantic search based on meaning, not keywords
* Context-grounded answer generation using LLM
* Display source document for answers
